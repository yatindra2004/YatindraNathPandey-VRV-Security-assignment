Technologies Used
    React: For building UI components.
    React Context API: For managing global state (e.g., user roles, posts).
    React Router: For handling navigation and protected routes.
    Reducer: For centralized state management.
    Tailwind CSS: For styling components and ensuring a responsive layout.

State Management
    The project uses React Context API and Reducer for efficient state management:

    Context API: Manages global states such as user roles, posts, and login status, avoiding the need for prop drilling.
    Reducer: Centralizes state updates like adding or deleting users, toggling roles, and managing posts.

State Management
The project uses React Context API and Reducer for efficient state management:

Context API: Manages global states such as user roles, posts, and login status, avoiding the need for prop drilling.
Reducer: Centralizes state updates like adding or deleting users, toggling roles, and managing posts.
Routing & Permissions
Protected Routes:
Ensures users can only access pages they’re authorized for, based on roles. Unauthorized users are redirected to an "Unauthorized" page.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Admin: Manage users and their roles (user/creator).
Creators: Create and view posts.
Users: View posts and follow creators.
